 Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".

 What if the given main.java.bupt.wxy.tree could be any binary main.java.bupt.wxy.tree? Would your previous solution still work?

 Note:

 You may only use constant extra space.
 For example,
 Given the following binary main.java.bupt.wxy.tree,
 1
 /  \
 2    3
 / \    \
 4   5    7
 After calling your function, the main.java.bupt.wxy.tree should look like:
 1 -> NULL
 /  \
 2 -> 3 -> NULL
 / \    \
 4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL

public class Solution_117 {
    public void connect(TreeLinkNode root) {
        new Solution_116().connect(root);
    }
}
